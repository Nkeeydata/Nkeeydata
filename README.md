Hi, I’m Nkechika Akpe. I’m a Data Analyst with proficiency in Excel, working with DAX and Power Query Editor in Power BI, and currently building my skills on Tableau. I’m looking for Entry level jobs where my skills and experience will be put to use. You can reach me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkechika-collins-akpe
Fun fact about me is that I love calculations, and also love travelling when on vacation.
