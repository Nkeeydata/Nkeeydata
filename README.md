Hi, I’m Nkechika Collins Akpe. A Data Analyst with proficiency in Excel, PostgreSQL, working with DAX and Power Query Editor in Power BI, and Tableau. I transitioned from sales field into Data Analysis due to my love for data and calculations. Although, I had my first degree in Computer Science, but had to pick a sales job due to availability at the moment. You will learn various Data Analysis methodology on my page using different software. I love to collaborate with hardworking individuals who see to it that deadelines are meant irrespective of the circumstances. I believe in commiting to my progress on a daily basis no matter the duration. You can reach me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkechika-collins-akpe
Fun fact about me is that I love calculations, and also love travelling when on vacation.
