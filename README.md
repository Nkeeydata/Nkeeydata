Hi, I’m Nkechika Collins Akpe. A Data Analyst with proficiency in Excel, Power BI, PostgreSQL, Tableau, and Python working with DAX and Power Query Editor in Power BI. I transitioned from Sales profession into Data Analysis due to my love for data and calculations, coupled with my background on Computer Science as my first degree. I studied Data Analysis with Cybersafe foundation where I learnt PostgreSQL, Excel and Power BI for Analysis, and also went on to have a Diploma in Data Analysis and Business Intelligence at Baze University in partnership with World bank scholarship. I continue to develop my skills in the various tools used for analysis, while furthering in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I used my projects to discover the problems in organisations and profer solutions through insights drawn from the analysis from the datasets.

Fun fact about me is that I love calculations, and also love travelling when on vacation.
